    "description": "Introducing Pavlov's Daughters — a literary magazine for the disobedient, the dissected, and the done-being-diagnosed. Our mission: Radically increase the representation of women in neuroscience and psychology- not just as subjects of study, but as the scientists, thinkers, and creators. We publish work that bites back: neuro-feminist essays, rage-fueled poetry, experimental prose and zines with teeth. And right now, positions are open for graphic design interns where you design posts related to neuroscience and psychology in exchange for volunteer letters and even letters of recommendation from staff!! Follow us, share us, submit your brain to the chaos. We don't wait for the bell. We rewire it.",
